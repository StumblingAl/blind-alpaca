<h1>Explanation</h1>

<h4>Set Up</h4>
<p>
    I've used a clone of angular-seed to set this project up. Therefore the backend runs on NodeJS http-server. Both NPM and Bower have been used to get the project running and install the various dependencies.
    <br/><br/>
    Home (View 1) uses the $http/ngRoute dependencies to demonstrate use of a public REST API. A POST request is sent to the API with the parameters taken from the user input.


</p>

<h4>MVC</h4>
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>View: 3 of these have been included - 1 per application menu item</li>
    <li>Controller: 1 controller per view, split into functions</li>
</ul>


<h4>AngularJS v1.5</h4>
<ul>
    <li>$http get and post examples - ngroute</li>
    <li>Inclusion of external libraries - angular-spinner</li>
    <li>Error handling</li>
</ul>

<h4>Git</h4>
Clone of Angular-Seed project. Then forked to blind-alpaca (replacing the origin).

<h4>Bootstrap</h4>
Bootstrap 3 has been used, utilising the grid layout included with it and other standard optimised properties.
